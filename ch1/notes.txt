Java programs are protable--that is, Java programs can be executed without modification on any computer that has a java interpreter(JVM)

-> Every and any computer with a Java interpreter can run Java programs without modification to the programs. So a Java program written on a windows will run the same way on a Mac. If we were to install a JVM on the mars rover then it too would be able to run our programs.
