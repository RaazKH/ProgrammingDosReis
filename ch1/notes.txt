Java programs are protable--that is, Java programs can be executed without modification on any computer that has a java interpreter(JVM)

-> Every and any computer with a Java interpreter can run Java programs without modification to the programs. So a Java program written on a windows will run the same way on a Mac. If we were to install a JVM on the mars rover then it too would be able to run our programs.

Syntax errors are violations of the rules of a programming language(leaving extra parenthesis")" or brace"}")

Logic errors are mistakes in the logic of the code. We want the code to print out 1 + 2 but it prints out 1 - 2.

Compile-time-errors are errors detected by javac at compiletime. Logic errors will not be shown here.
